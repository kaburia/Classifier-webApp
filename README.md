# Classifier-webApp

This repository contains code for a web application that performs image classification to determine if an image is real or fake. The web application is built using Python and Flask, and uses a pre-trained deep learning model for image classification. The user can upload an image, and the web application will classify the image as either real or fake, and display the result with a bar graph showing the probability of each classification.
